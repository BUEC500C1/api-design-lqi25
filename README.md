- I, a tourist, want to know the current weather conditions at the airport.

## OpenWeather API
The OpenWeather API supports multiple functions, which can get the current weather conditions, historical weather records, and forecast future weather conditions by city name, latitude and longitude. You need to register at https://openweathermap.org/api and get the API key. The obtained data format is json data, which includes temperature, weather, latitude and longitude, humidity and other information.
